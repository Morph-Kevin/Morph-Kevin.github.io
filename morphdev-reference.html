                    API - Application Programming Interface <br>
                    From Wikipedia: An application programming interface is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.
                    <br>
                    API is a generic term that encompasses many possible contexts. In the case of Morph Dev an api typically refers to communicating with a <a href="#server">sever</a> to get data from or send data to a web based <a href="#saas">SaaS</a>.

                    JavaScript is an interpreted programming language. Its popularity has led to its use in varied ways accross software development but is most closely associated with internet technologies. Along with <a href="#html">HTML</a> 
                    and <a href="#CSS">CSS</a>, Javascript is one of the 3 technologies that makes up the modern web (At least for the <a href="#client">Client</a>). Where HTML provides the structure of a webpage and CSS provides the visual styling, JavaScript provides the functionality and logic.
                    For example JS can be used to do everything from make network requests to respond to user input on a page. JavaScript is excecuted on the client's computer after the website files have be downloaded from the server.

                    An SPA is a webpage where all of the website structure (and sometimes content) is delivered in the initial response from the <a href="#server">server</a>. Site navigation takes place via javascript code and content is loaded in dynamically from the server.
                    SPAa have the advantage of a much more responsive user experience since all of the website's code is downloaded to the <a href="#client">Client</a> immediately and they tend to feel like a native application rather than a website.
